    "When working with supercomputers, one often has to move files from a local computer to a supercomputer and back, or from one supercomputer to another. There are a few ways to do this, but the most basic and standard is at the command line using the linux utilities **scp** and **rsync**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, **scp** stands for \"secure copy\" and lets you move files or folders from one machine to another. This is the most basic way to move files, and is great for a small amount of data. The second utility, **rsync**, synchronizes entire folders, so you only copy files that have changed, and it can compress files for transfer. Thus, **rsync** is good for moving larger amounts of files or bigger files. Today we will move one file (this lab) from your local computer to the LSU HPC so you can work on your lab there, then move it back.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic **scp** syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**scp**   path_to_local_file   user@host:path_to_destination\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "**scp** source target\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to use **scp** you need to know the file path where your file currently is and the path to where you want it to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you will want to use the two terminal windows opened in the warmup, on where you have logged on to the HPC, and one on your local computer. Locate the folder where you downloaded the lab using the basic linux commands **cd** for change directory, **ls** for listing the directory contents, and **pwd** for printing the \"working\" directory, the path to where you are. I will demo these.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the above linux commands to identify the path to where you have downloaded this lab, and where you want to put it on the supercomputer. Then use **scp** to copy the lab to the super computer. For me this was:\n",
    "\n",
    "scp /Users/chsharri/Documents/Teaching/Sci_comp/Sci_comp_F2024/Course_materials/Lab11.2_F24_linear_regression.ipynb chsharri@mike.hpc.lsu.edu:/home/chsharri/\n",
    "\n",

    "Moving files between supercomputers or from one supercomputer to another is a common task when dealing with supercomputers. The most straightforward and common method is to use the Linux tools scp and rsync at the command line.\n",

    "The term \"secure copy\" (scp) essentially refers to the ability to transfer files or folders across computers. This is the simplest method of file transfer and works well for tiny data sets. The second tool, rsync, may compress files for transmission and synchronize whole directories, allowing you to copy only the modified items. Consequently, rsync works well for transferring larger or more complex files. We will transfer this lab file from your local computer to the LSU HPC today so you may complete it there and then return it.\n",
