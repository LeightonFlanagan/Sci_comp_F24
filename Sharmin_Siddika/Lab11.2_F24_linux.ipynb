    "When working with supercomputers, one often has to move files from a local computer to a supercomputer and back, or from one supercomputer to another. There are a few ways to do this, but the most basic and standard is at the command line using the linux utilities **scp** and **rsync**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, **scp** stands for \"secure copy\" and lets you move files or folders from one machine to another. This is the most basic way to move files, and is great for a small amount of data. The second utility, **rsync**, synchronizes entire folders, so you only copy files that have changed, and it can compress files for transfer. Thus, **rsync** is good for moving larger amounts of files or bigger files. Today we will move one file (this lab) from your local computer to the LSU HPC so you can work on your lab there, then move it back.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic **scp** syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**scp**   path_to_local_file   user@host:path_to_destination\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "**scp** source target\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to use **scp** you need to know the file path where your file currently is and the path to where you want it to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you will want to use the two terminal windows opened in the warmup, on where you have logged on to the HPC, and one on your local computer. Locate the folder where you downloaded the lab using the basic linux commands **cd** for change directory, **ls** for listing the directory contents, and **pwd** for printing the \"working\" directory, the path to where you are. I will demo these.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the above linux commands to identify the path to where you have downloaded this lab, and where you want to put it on the supercomputer. Then use **scp** to copy the lab to the super computer. For me this was:\n",
    "\n",
    "scp /Users/chsharri/Documents/Teaching/Sci_comp/Sci_comp_F2024/Course_materials/Lab11.2_F24_linear_regression.ipynb chsharri@mike.hpc.lsu.edu:/home/chsharri/\n",
    "\n",
    "Note I put the \"/\" on the end of the target path to indicate the directory. This will copy the full name of the python notebook into that directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "I entered this command in the terminal window on my **local** computer. Note you will be asked for your lsu hpc password.\n",
